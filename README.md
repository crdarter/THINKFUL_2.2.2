Visualizing data exercise

The main difference between the Amount.Funded.By.Investors and Amount.Requested, is that none requested $0 (the probability was not given for $0 in the probability plot), but in some cases that was the amount funded.  This makes sense since not all loas are approved.  Based on the Probability plots, it would appear that the lending club has a cieling for loans requested of $35k, or at least that is what is suggested by this data set.

The histogram results also suggest that the Amount.Requested is overall more than that of the Amount.Funded.By.Investors; this is reinforced by the results of the box plot where there are more upper bound outliers for Ammount.Funded.By.Investors.
